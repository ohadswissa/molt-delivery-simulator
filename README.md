# Molt Delivery Simulator – Data Structures Project

This project simulates a basic delivery platform (like Wolt) using custom data structures.  
Developed as part of the Data Structures course at Reichman University (2024).

## 🛠 Core Features

- **Min-Heap (Generic):** Custom implementation of a type-safe binary min-heap with:
  - Insert, deleteMin, findMin
  - Merge in linear time
  - Capacity handling and resizing

- **MoltOrder & MoltDriver:** 
  - Both implement `Comparable`
  - Simulate real-world prioritization and driver scheduling logic

## 📚 Key Concepts

- Java Generics & Interfaces
- Priority queues & Comparable pattern
- Object-oriented simulation logic

## 🧪 Technologies

- Java 11
- No external libraries
- Structure supports testing with JUnit
